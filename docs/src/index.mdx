# Getting Started

`react-ags-maps` is a react component library that wraps up the ArcGIS for JavaScript API into react components. 

The goal is to make the API more declarative and allow for quick and easy construction of webmaps, while perserving the typing and extendability allowed by the base API.


# Install

run
<code>
yarn install react-ags-maps
</code>
or
<code>
npm install react-ags-maps
</code>

# Usage
See the [map component](./src-map-component-map) to get started and see demos.
